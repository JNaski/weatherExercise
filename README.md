#  OpenWeather API exercise

This is a small project made as an exercise to use openweathermap.org

This exercise contains only front code.

You will need your own api key

> npm install
>
> npm start

to install and start the program


The program defaults the weather to
Heidenheim (a town in Germany), but it allows
you to search for different cities as well.
